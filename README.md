# 🔐 Xodus App — Secure Cross-Platform File Sharing & Media Streaming

## Overview
**Xodus App** is a secure, cross-platform file-sharing and media-streaming system custom USB dongle. It enables fast, private file transfers, audio streaming, and video playback across Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows — without relying on cloud infrastructure.

This project reflects my focus on building **fully local, privacy-first software** that protects users and organizations by minimizing external dependencies.

## Cybersecurity Relevance
Xodus demonstrates my ability to design and implement secure, privacy-focused systems that support organizational security goals:

- Data remains local, eliminating cloud exposure  
- Secure device discovery and permission handling  
- Reduced attack surface through offline operations  
- Emphasis on confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA triad)  
- Real-world integration of hardware and software security principles

## Personal Security Philosophy
I believe in developing systems that **run fully local** to improve security, privacy, and cost efficiency.  
Cloud services introduce ongoing costs and potential vulnerabilities, while local-first design ensures data ownership, autonomy, and reliability.  
My upcoming project, **Evocore**, continues this philosophy — an AI-powered system designed to operate entirely offline for maximum privacy.
